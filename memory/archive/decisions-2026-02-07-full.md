## YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm
Context: <task or feature>
Type: decision | mistake | preference | todo
Event: <what happened>
Action: <what changed / fix applied>
Rule: <one-line future behavior>

## 2026-02-07 08:36
Context: Design-system migration phase 1 (modals/toasts/panels/diff)
Type: decision
Event: Added additive design-system primitives (`ModalShell`, `ToastViewport`/`ToastCard`, `PanelFrame`/`PanelHeader`) and DS token alias styles with backward-compatible legacy class usage.
Action: Migrated target families to use primitives without removing existing class hooks; extracted diff unsafe CSS theme values into a DS module.
Rule: For modal/toast/panel shell changes, use DS primitives first and keep legacy classes as compatibility aliases until phase-2 cleanup is complete.

## 2026-02-07 08:51
Context: Design-system migration phase 2 cleanup (modals/toasts/panels/diff)
Type: decision
Event: Removed targeted legacy shell class wiring and consolidated duplicated shell chrome into DS styles (`ds-modal`, `ds-toast`, `ds-panel`) while keeping feature classes for content/layout only.
Action: Prompt modals now use `ModalShell` without per-modal backdrop/card selectors, toasts share DS card chrome/animation/tokens, panel shell layout moved into `PanelFrame` styles, and diff theme defaults are sourced from DS tokens with theme-specific overrides in `ds-diff.css`.
Rule: New or refactored modal/toast/panel code must extend DS primitives/tokens first and only keep feature selectors for non-shared behavior.

## 2026-02-07 09:48
Context: Design-system migration hardening (toast semantics + modal shell consistency)
Type: decision
Event: Decoupled DS toast styling from feature class names and migrated settings modal to `ModalShell`.
Action: Added `ToastTitle`/`ToastBody` primitives with DS-owned classes, tightened toast role typing to `AriaRole`, updated migrated toasts to use semantic primitives, and switched `SettingsView` to `ModalShell` via `cardClassName`.
Rule: DS primitives must own shared semantic classes and shell composition; feature components should only add feature-local classes/behavior.

## 2026-02-07 10:48
Context: Accessibility hardening for DS modal/panel primitives
Type: decision
Event: Added explicit tab semantics/keyboard navigation to `PanelTabs` and exposed modal labelling props on `ModalShell`.
Action: `PanelTabs` now uses `role="tab"` + `aria-selected` + roving `tabIndex` with arrow/home/end navigation; `ModalShell` now accepts `ariaLabel`/`ariaLabelledBy`/`ariaDescribedBy` and consumers pass labels (including `SettingsView` via `ariaLabelledBy`).
Rule: New modal consumers must provide an accessible label via `ModalShell`, and tablist UIs should use proper tab semantics instead of `aria-current`.

## 2026-02-07 10:58
Context: Design-system migration phase 2 completion for toasts
Type: decision
Event: Added shared toast sub-primitives for repeated header/action/error patterns and migrated approval/error/update toast families to use them.
Action: Introduced `ToastHeader`, `ToastActions`, and `ToastError` in DS primitives, moved shared styles into `ds-toast.css`, and reduced feature toast CSS to family-specific positioning/content rules.
Rule: Toast family updates must use DS toast sub-primitives for shared structure/patterns and keep feature styles focused on family-specific behavior only.

## 2026-02-07 11:11
Context: Design-system migration phase 3 guardrails
Type: decision
Event: Implemented lint guardrails and codemod automation for modal/toast/panel/diff DS adoption.
Action: Added targeted `no-restricted-syntax` checks in `.eslintrc.cjs`, created codemods (`modal-shell`, `panel-shell`, `toast-shell`) with dry-run/allowlist support, and wired package scripts (`codemod:ds:dry`, `codemod:ds`, `lint:ds`).
Rule: DS migration follow-ups should first run `npm run codemod:ds:dry` and keep DS guardrail lint rules green before merging UI shell changes.

## 2026-02-07 11:15
Context: Design-system migration phase 3 legacy selector cleanup
Type: decision
Event: Manual QA sign-off was completed and the remaining unreferenced legacy selectors were removed.
Action: Deleted dead selectors from `src/styles/diff.css` (`git-panel-title`, `git-panel-title-button`, `git-panel-switch-icon`, `git-panel-icon`, `git-pr-branches`) and revalidated with lint/typecheck/tests.
Rule: After DS migration QA sign-off, remove only selectors with verified zero callsites and rerun full validation.

## 2026-02-07 11:26
Context: AGENTS.md design-system guidance refresh
Type: decision
Event: Updated AGENTS design-system guidance to match the final implementation state after Phase 3.
Action: Documented toast/panel sub-primitives, Phase 3 guardrail/codemod workflow, and current migration status in `AGENTS.md`.
Rule: Keep `AGENTS.md` DS guidance aligned with the latest enforced primitives/scripts and migration state after each DS phase change.

## 2026-02-07 11:22
Context: PanelTabs keyboard navigation reliability
Type: decision
Event: Arrow/Home/End keyboard navigation in `PanelTabs` could stall because selection changed without moving focus.
Action: Navigation now derives from the active tab index and programmatically focuses the newly selected tab; added `PanelTabs.test.tsx` coverage for focus + selection progression.
Rule: Tab keyboard navigation must always move both selection state and DOM focus together.

## 2026-02-07 11:27
Context: AGENTS canonical style
Type: preference
Event: User requested removing phase-progress wording from `AGENTS.md` so it stays canonical and current-state only.
Action: Removed phase-specific wording from the design-system enforcement section title.
Rule: Keep `AGENTS.md` free of phase labels/progress framing; document canonical behavior and workflow only.

## 2026-02-07 11:37
Context: Design-system popover standardization
Type: preference
Event: User requested all app popovers use one consistent pattern with iconized precomputed menu entries and Escape/outside-click dismissal behavior.
Action: Added DS popover primitives/styles and migrated popover/dropdown callsites (branch/worktree menus, sidebar add/sort/account menus, launch script, open-app menus, workspace-home run mode/models, composer suggestions, file preview) to use shared shell semantics and dismiss behavior.
Rule: New popover/dropdown UI should use DS popover primitives, include leading icons for precomputed action lists, and close on Escape/outside click unless explicitly exempted.

## 2026-02-07 11:40
Context: AGENTS canonical DS documentation update
Type: decision
Event: Canonical design-system guidance needed to include popover primitives and style sources after popover migration.
Action: Updated `AGENTS.md` design-system section to list `PopoverPrimitives.tsx`, `PopoverSurface`/`PopoverMenuItem`, and `ds-popover.css` plus popover-specific do/don't guidance.
Rule: Keep AGENTS design-system inventory aligned with currently implemented DS primitives and styles, without claiming guardrails that are not implemented.

## 2026-02-07 11:42
Context: Popover design-system regression guardrails
Type: decision
Event: Added lint enforcement to prevent regressions back to raw popover shell/menu-row markup in migrated files.
Action: Added `.eslintrc.cjs` popover override covering migrated popover components, requiring `PopoverSurface`/`PopoverMenuItem` patterns and keeping DS token color-literal restrictions in scope.
Rule: Popover changes in guarded files must keep DS primitive markup and pass lint before merge.

## 2026-02-07 12:03
Context: Frontend telemetry regression restoration
Type: preference
Event: User requested full restoration of Sentry reporting removed in `83a37da`.
Action: Reintroduced `@sentry/react`, restored `Sentry.init` in `src/main.tsx`, and re-enabled removed capture/metrics callsites in app/workspace/thread/file-link flows.
Rule: Keep Sentry telemetry enabled unless the user explicitly asks to deprecate or replace it with another telemetry provider.

## 2026-02-07 12:17
Context: Duplicate telemetry prevention for New Agent creation
Type: decision
Event: New Agent creation could be triggered twice for `Cmd+N` because both a web keydown hook and native menu accelerator path were active.
Action: Removed `useNewAgentShortcut` from `useWorkspaceActions` so New Agent creation flows through a single menu/command path (`useAppMenuEvents` + configured menu accelerators), and added focused Composer tests to assert one send call for Enter and send-button triggers.
Rule: For accelerator-backed actions, keep a single trigger path to avoid double action execution and duplicate telemetry.

## 2026-02-07 12:27
Context: Windows updater 404 from release metadata
Type: decision
Event: Published `latest.json` referenced asset names that did not match uploaded release asset filenames, causing updater download 404s.
Action: Updated `.github/workflows/release.yml` to normalize artifact filenames before publish, URL-encode generated `latest.json` URLs, and validate that every `latest.json` URL maps to an actual artifact before creating the release.
Rule: Generate `latest.json` URLs from normalized artifact filenames and fail the release job if any referenced asset is missing.

## 2026-02-07 13:26
Context: Mobile remote architecture direction
Type: preference
Event: User chose Cloudflare as the bridge for mobile-to-desktop remote backend connectivity and questioned duplicating backend logic in-app.
Action: Adopted plan direction toward a Cloudflare bridge layer (realtime transport + durable queue/snapshots) while keeping daemon/core logic as the execution authority on desktop.
Rule: Mobile remote mode should connect through a Cloudflare bridge to the desktop daemon, not a duplicated backend implementation on-device.

## 2026-02-07 13:26
Context: Remote-mode implementation strategy
Type: decision
Event: Command/event parity analysis showed major mismatch between local Tauri commands and daemon RPC coverage.
Action: Established parity-first roadmap: complete daemon RPC surface and remote adapter routing before shipping mobile remote mode.
Rule: Remote/mobile rollouts must gate on command/event parity with local mode for user-facing features.

## 2026-02-07 13:31
Context: Mobile bridge implementation direction
Type: preference
Event: User explicitly requested to ignore PR #31 and CloudKit for mobile architecture planning.
Action: Canonical mobile plan now targets Cloudflare bridge only, with no dependency on CloudKit or PR #31 implementation details.
Rule: Do not propose CloudKit/PR31-based mobile backend patterns unless user re-requests them.

## 2026-02-07 15:11
Context: Mobile UI scope confirmation
Type: preference
Event: User confirmed iOS should reuse the current app layout's mobile variant instead of introducing a separate mobile-only UI surface.
Action: Treat mobile work as backend/connectivity enablement for existing mobile-responsive UI flows.
Rule: For iOS rollout, prioritize backend/transport parity for existing UI flows before designing net-new mobile-specific screens.

## 2026-02-07 15:26
Context: App/daemon parity refactor quality bar
Type: preference
Event: User requested parity work avoid repeated logical code between app and daemon, with shared implementations as the default.
Action: Current in-progress daemon parity changes must be completed by extracting/using shared core helpers instead of duplicating logic in daemon-specific functions.
Rule: For app/daemon parity, keep domain logic in shared modules and restrict app/daemon code to thin adapters.

## 2026-02-07 15:42
Context: Daemon parity implementation scope for mobile wiring
Type: preference
Event: User explicitly excluded terminal and dictation from current mobile/remote parity work.
Action: Implemented daemon RPC parity for non-terminal/non-dictation methods and validated parity gap now contains only `terminal_*` and `dictation_*` commands.
Rule: For current mobile remote-mode rollout, treat terminal and dictation RPC parity as out of scope unless the user re-enables them.

## 2026-02-07 16:58
Context: App/daemon parity dedup for mobile remote-mode backend
Type: decision
Event: Refactored duplicated prompt/local-usage/codex-utility/git logic into shared core modules and switched app/daemon code to adapter-only wrappers.
Action: Added `shared/prompts_core.rs`, `shared/local_usage_core.rs`, `shared/codex_aux_core.rs`, and `shared/git_ui_core.rs`; rewired `prompts.rs`, `local_usage.rs`, `git/mod.rs`, `codex/mod.rs`, and daemon method handlers to call shared functions.
Rule: Keep user-facing git/prompt/local-usage/codex utility behavior in shared cores and keep app/daemon files limited to transport/wiring responsibilities.

## 2026-02-07 17:22
Context: Remaining workspace-action parity dedup
Type: decision
Event: `add_clone`, `apply_worktree_changes`, `open_workspace_in`, and `get_open_app_icon` still duplicated between app and daemon after first parity refactor pass.
Action: Moved those behaviors into `shared/workspaces_core.rs` (`add_clone_core`, `apply_worktree_changes_core`, `open_workspace_in_core`, `get_open_app_icon_core`) and rewired both app (`workspaces/commands.rs`) and daemon (`codex_monitor_daemon.rs`) to thin adapters.
Rule: Keep workspace action behavior shared-first; app and daemon should only pass environment dependencies and transport payloads.

## 2026-02-07 17:26
Context: Backend test-target dead code warnings
Type: decision
Event: `cargo test` warnings came from a truly unused test hook and a test helper compiled in targets that do not reference it.
Action: Removed unused `set_window_appearance_override` from `window.rs`; added `#[allow(dead_code)]` to `workspaces/settings.rs::sort_workspaces` (test-only helper used in lib tests but not daemon test target).
Rule: Remove genuinely unused test hooks; for cross-target test helpers, use narrow `#[allow(dead_code)]` instead of broad warning suppression.

## 2026-02-07 17:32
Context: Mobile parity verification policy
Type: preference
Event: User explicitly requested no CI parity guard for this phase and to rely on local validation.
Action: Updated mobile Cloudflare blueprint to remove CI parity guard requirements and require local parity validation only.
Rule: For current mobile/remote scope, do not add CI parity guardrails unless user requests them again.

## 2026-02-07 17:47
Context: Mobile remote bridge provider finalization
Type: preference
Event: User selected Orbit-only path for mobile remote architecture and requested canonical plan updates away from custom Cloudflare bridge implementation.
Action: Rewrote `docs/mobile-ios-cloudflare-blueprint.md` to Orbit-only architecture, setup flows, settings model, transport refactor, and implementation milestones; removed custom Worker/DO protocol/envelope sections.
Rule: For current mobile rollout, plan and implementation should target Orbit integration only (hosted and self-host modes), not a custom bridge protocol/service.

## 2026-02-07 17:39
Context: Daemon parity hardening follow-up
Type: decision
Event: Added daemon-side RPC parity coverage for recently extracted workspace/prompts/local-usage adapters and improved open-app failure diagnostics.
Action: Added RPC tests in `src-tauri/src/bin/codex_monitor_daemon.rs` for `add_clone`, `prompts_list`, and `local_usage_snapshot` routing; updated `open_workspace_in_core` in `src-tauri/src/shared/workspaces_core.rs` to include bounded stdout/stderr snippets in non-zero exit errors.
Rule: Keep daemon adapter parity guarded by RPC-level tests for representative workspace/prompts/local-usage methods, and preserve process-output context in open-app failure errors.

## 2026-02-07 17:52
Context: Remote backend transport abstraction for mobile bridge prep
Type: decision
Event: Remote backend was a single TCP-specific module with no transport-level provider split.
Action: Refactored `src-tauri/src/remote_backend.rs` into `remote_backend/{mod,protocol,transport,tcp_transport,cloudflare_ws_transport}.rs`, added `remoteBackendProvider` + Cloudflare settings fields, kept TCP behavior as default, and added a Cloudflare transport stub that returns a clear not-implemented error.
Rule: Keep remote transport wiring behind `RemoteTransport` and use provider selection in settings so new bridge transports can be added without touching command callsites.

## 2026-02-07 17:58
Context: Cloudflare transport implementation pass
Type: decision
Event: Cloudflare transport stub blocked real remote bridge connectivity testing.
Action: Implemented `cloudflare_ws_transport` with real WebSocket connect/read/write loops via `tokio-tungstenite`, shared incoming dispatch/pending-response handling, URL normalization to `/ws/{sessionId}`, and transport-level disconnect propagation.
Rule: New remote transports should reuse shared dispatch/disconnect helpers and preserve the same request/response semantics as TCP transport.

## 2026-02-07 18:00
Context: Mobile Cloudflare blueprint canonicalization
Type: decision
Event: Blueprint still referenced pre-refactor remote backend structure and outdated settings keys after transport work landed.
Action: Updated `docs/mobile-ios-cloudflare-blueprint.md` to reflect implemented remote backend module split, Cloudflare WS transport status, current provider settings fields, and remaining reconnect/replay hardening work.
Rule: Keep blueprint "Current State" and backend/settings sections synchronized with merged transport architecture before starting new milestone work.

## 2026-02-07 18:09
Context: Orbit-only provider canonicalization
Type: decision
Event: Backend/provider/settings naming still reflected Cloudflare-specific labels after Orbit-only direction was finalized.
Action: Renamed remote transport/provider/settings model to Orbit (`orbit_ws_transport`, `RemoteBackendProvider::Orbit`, `orbit*` settings), retained serde aliases for legacy Cloudflare config keys, and updated the mobile blueprint/todo notes to Orbit-first language.
Rule: Keep runtime/provider naming Orbit-first while preserving narrow backward-compatible aliases only for persisted legacy settings.

## 2026-02-07 18:13
Context: Orbit-only feature branch compatibility policy
Type: preference
Event: User requested removing all unreleased Cloudflare fallback/backport compatibility paths and tests.
Action: Removed provider/url/session legacy compatibility aliases, removed legacy session URL injection logic, and deleted backport-focused tests from remote backend and settings models.
Rule: For this unreleased Orbit workstream, keep settings and transport strictly canonical without backward-compat adapters.

## 2026-02-07 18:52
Context: Orbit desktop setup UX and app/daemon dedup
Type: decision
Event: Orbit sign-in in Settings previously did not poll using the real device-code contract, and app/daemon each kept local settings parsing helpers.
Action: Updated Settings sign-in flow to poll `orbit_sign_in_poll` with `deviceCode` until terminal status, added injectable Orbit service client for deterministic tests, and moved Orbit settings/url/token extraction helpers into `shared/orbit_core.rs` for app+daemon reuse.
Rule: Keep Orbit auth/session behavior contract-driven (typed `deviceCode` flow) and share settings parsing/token helpers in `shared/orbit_core.rs` instead of adapter-local duplicates.

## 2026-02-07 19:39
Context: Orbit token persistence parity hardening
Type: decision
Event: App and daemon both needed the same latest-state-safe token persistence behavior after Orbit poll/sign-out.
Action: Added `update_remote_backend_token_core` in `shared/settings_core.rs` and switched both Orbit adapters to use it instead of cloning stale settings snapshots.
Rule: Persist Orbit token changes only via shared settings-core mutation helpers to avoid app/daemon divergence and stale overwrite races.

## 2026-02-07 20:11
Context: SettingsView component decomposition
Type: decision
Event: Split `SettingsView` into section-focused components plus a dedicated sidebar nav while keeping orchestration/state in the container.
Action: Added `SettingsNav`, extracted section components under `src/features/settings/components/sections/*`, introduced shared settings types in `settingsTypes.ts`, and rewired `SettingsView.tsx` to modal shell + section routing.
Rule: For large settings surfaces, keep `SettingsView` as layout/orchestration and move section UI into dedicated components with typed props.

## 2026-02-07 20:23
Context: Orbit product scope canonicalization
Type: decision
Event: Product direction is now self-hosted Orbit only; app should not present hosted Orbit mode or imply CodexMonitor-hosted relay/auth services.
Action: Removed `orbitDeploymentMode` from frontend/backend settings models and defaults, removed deployment mode selector from Settings UI, and updated mobile Orbit blueprint/setup language to self-host-only.
Rule: Keep Orbit setup/docs/UI self-host-only unless user explicitly requests reintroducing hosted mode.

## 2026-02-07 20:48
Context: Tailscale bootstrap path for mobile remote onboarding
Type: decision
Event: Added end-to-end Tailscale setup support so users can self-host remote TCP access before iOS Orbit UX is finalized.
Action: Implemented desktop `tailscale_status` and `tailscale_daemon_command_preview` commands, wired Settings helpers (detect, suggested host, daemon command), and updated blueprint docs to include the Tailscale bootstrap flow.
Rule: Keep Tailscale as the first-run self-host bootstrap path for TCP remote setup while Orbit remains the production relay path.

## 2026-02-07 21:04
Context: Remote provider maturity signaling in Settings UI
Type: preference
Event: User requested both TCP and Orbit provider options be visibly marked as in progress.
Action: Updated provider selector labels to `TCP (wip)` and `Orbit (wip)` in settings.
Rule: Keep both remote provider labels marked `(wip)` until user requests removal after production-readiness.

## 2026-02-07 21:06
Context: Conversation auto-scroll regression (jump before re-pin)
Type: decision
Event: Smooth, delayed auto-scroll on streaming/appended messages caused visible upward jump then repin in the conversation view.
Action: Updated `Messages` auto-scroll paths to immediate container-bottom pinning (`scrollTop = scrollHeight`) and removed delayed smooth auto-scroll behavior for automatic updates.
Rule: Automatic message pinning should be immediate and non-animated; reserve smooth scrolling for explicit user-initiated navigation only.

## 2026-02-07 21:16
Context: Desktop Tailscale CLI detection in Tauri runtime
Type: decision
Event: Settings reported missing Tailscale CLI even when installed because GUI runtime PATH did not include shell-resolved aliases/paths.
Action: Added Tailscale binary candidate resolution (`PATH` first, then standard install paths including macOS app bundle path) before status checks.
Rule: Desktop CLI integrations must not rely on shell aliases or login-shell PATH alone; include deterministic install-path fallbacks.

## 2026-02-07 21:24
Context: Composer typing lag while non-active threads stream updates
Type: decision
Event: Thread status actions (`markProcessing`, `markUnread`, `markReviewing`) were creating new reducer state even when values were unchanged, and composer/sidebar surfaces lacked memo boundaries against unrelated parent re-renders.
Action: Added no-op guards in `useThreadsReducer` for unchanged thread-status transitions and wrapped `Composer`/`Sidebar` in `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary rerenders on unrelated app-state updates.
Rule: Streaming/event reducers must return previous state for no-op status transitions, and high-churn UI shells should be memoized to isolate typing/input responsiveness.
